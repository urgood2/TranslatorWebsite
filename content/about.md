intro: >-
  Hi! I'm Felipe Cordero, a **structural engineer** and **software developer** with **14+ years** in AEC, now expanding my expertise into **AI/ML**. My journey has taken me from Chile to Montréal, where I combine traditional engineering with modern technology to solve complex problems in engineering and automation. Recently, I was honored with the Academic Excellence Scholarship (Air Canada, Collège LaSalle Montréal, 2025) for my achievements in AI/ML studies.

study: >-
  Currently based in Montréal, I'm deepening my skills in **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning** at Collège LaSalle. I work with **Python**, **PyTorch**, and **predictive modeling** to build intelligent systems that bridge the gap between engineering and data science.

  I'm passionate about learning and applying AI to real-world engineering challenges. At <a href="https://fireraven.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Fireraven</strong></a>, I help develop a Low-code Security and Compliance SaaS platform for **LLM Assistants and Agents**. Previously at <a href="https://obralink.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>ObraLink</strong></a>, I led the development of **autonomous structural analysis tools** and **ML models** for concrete estimation. My goal is to create innovative solutions that have a real impact on the built environment.

mix: >-
  With experience in both **structural engineering** and **software development**, I bring a unique perspective to technical challenges. I've led teams in building everything from physical structures to scalable software systems, always focusing on practical, efficient solutions. My international background and commitment to continuous learning drive me to bridge disciplines and deliver value across industries.

personal: >-
  Outside work, I enjoy **tennis**, **cooking**, **drums**, **swimming**, and **photography**. I also volunteer at LaSalle College, helping new students settle in and supporting the academic community.
