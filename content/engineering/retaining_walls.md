## Welcome! 👋


During my early days in structural engineering, I developed a Cantilever Concrete Retaining Wall Designer to assist with the design and analysis of retaining walls using Python. Today, I'm excited to present its modern version as a web application, powered by Streamlit.

**Software developed to streamline the design and detailing process of retaining walls. The program allows:**

## Features 🚀

- **Define the parameters**
- **Define the dimensions**
- **Design the reinforcement (moment)**
- **Visualization**
