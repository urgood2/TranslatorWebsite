# Personal Website

This is my personal website built with Hugo, a fast and modern static site generator. The site features a clean, responsive design powered by Tailwind CSS and uses my own theme, CareerCanvas.

## 🚀 Features

- Built with Hugo static site generator
- Uses CareerCanvas theme (my own creation)
- Styled with Tailwind CSS
- Responsive design with dark mode support
- Typography plugin for better content formatting
- Custom layouts and templates
- Image galleries for project showcases
- Multilingual support (English/French)
- Interactive skills and experience sections

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/) (Extended version recommended)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for npm packages)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

## 🏗️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/felipecordero/felipecordero.github.io.git
cd felipecordero.github.io
```

2. Install npm dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## 🚀 Development

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command runs `hugo server -D`, which starts a local server and includes draft content (content with `draft: true` in the front matter). This is useful for previewing unpublished or in-progress content during development.

The site will be available at `http://localhost:1313`

## 🏗️ Building

To build the site for production, you need to:

1. Build the CSS with Tailwind:
```bash
npm run build:css
```

2. Build the site with Hugo:
```bash
npm run build
```

Or you can do both in one command:
```bash
npm run build:css && npm run build
```

The built site will be in the `public/` directory.

Note: The CSS build step is necessary because the site uses Tailwind CSS, which needs to be processed to generate the final CSS file with only the used styles.
